# Obstacle-Avoiding-Car



## Introduction

Obstacle Avoiding Car (OAC) is a project which uses an Arduino and an ultrasonic distance sensor to give a car the ability to navigate obstacles and avoid them. The distance information detected from the ultrasonic sensor will be sent to the Arduino which allows the car to control its motors and avoid obstacles. This project involves the basics of Arduino programming as well as different hardware concepts such as motor drivers, LEDs, resistors, and of course, breadboards. This is a good introduction project to Arduino and challenging enough to help you combine different concepts into a working product.
